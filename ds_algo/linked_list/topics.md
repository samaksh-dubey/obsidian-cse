methods:
1. dummy node
2. slow and fast pointer

problems:
1. reverse list (iterative | recurrsive) | reverse specific portion
2. even nodes to end in reverse order
3. split into two list with alternating elements
4. merge lists | divide int two list
5. intersection/union of two list
6. cycle detection and removal
7. remove duplicates
8. palindromic list
9. swap adjacent node | kth node
10. flatten
